I am so sad. Steve pulled my hair and Mommy didn't punish him.
Steve is so mean.

Today I learned how to spell diary. Dairy is something that comes
from a cow! Daddy is still sick and Steve has been gone for a few
days. Mommy says he's gone on a trip. How come I couldnt go?

I lost you for awhile! I found you today in the air vents. I wonder
howyou managed to get there. A lot of my toys have gone missing.
Mommy says Im just forgetful.

Dear Diary
I'm surprised that I still have you after all these years. Brings back
memories of a simpler time. Perhaps I will continue writing in you, for
the nostalgia of it.

He seems to know my every move. Father has not come back yet and I fear
for the worst. I miss Mother and wish she was here with me right now. 
I'm so alone down here. Hopefully someone will come for me soon.

Dear Diary
This will be my last entry. If someone ever finds this just know
that I tried my best. He will never be able to get out; but in turn,
neither will I. If you are reading this, get out of the house NOW.
I've hidden clues in this room to aid in your escape. I must prepare
now; he's found me.
